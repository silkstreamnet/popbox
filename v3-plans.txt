VERSION 3 PLANS
To do
- Add gallery extension support. Horizontal swipe support.
- Add native url content handling (ajax) extension support.
- Add fallback for content with forms for mobile devices. Done, needs testing.
- Add smooth popbox switching. (if one popbox is opened when another is already opened)
- Make sure different containers other than body work. Currently only supports body.
- Need ability to pre-adjust, edit html real-time, then finish adjust. (pre-adjust hides the content and finish adjust brings it back in)

Done
- Change function definition convention for private functions to var function plus camelCase.
- Change variables to underscore with jquery objects prepended with $.
- Change name of class to Popbox, only first letter capitalised.
- Target jQuery 1.7+
- Support CSS3 transitions over javascript animation.
- Change applyDataSettings method to applyDataToSettings.
- CSS3 transition complete events are unreliable, need a timeout slightly longer than animation time to make sure it isn't stuck.
- Take out awkward clone calculation and rely strictly on naturalWidth and naturalHeight from loaded image. If not supported, don't expect miracles.
- Add extension support to the plugin. Separate gallery functionality and extensive future animations to their own extension scripts.
- Add animation extension support.
- Add addEventListener method to popbox class. (need to store events in their own area, use the change to transition events as example)
