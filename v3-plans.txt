VERSION 3 PLANS
To do
- Add extension support to the plugin. Separate gallery functionality and extensive future animations to their own extension scripts.
- Take out awkward clone calculation and rely strictly on naturalWidth and naturalHeight from loaded image. If not supported, don't expect miracles.
- Native url content handling. Support popbox content switch. Support form submissions.
- Add addEventListener method to popbox class.
- CSS3 transition complete events are unreliable, need a timeout slightly longer than animation time to make sure it isn't stuck.

Done
- Change function definition convention for private functions to var function plus camelCase.
- Change variables to underscore with jquery objects prepended with $.
- Change name of class to Popbox, only first letter capitalised.
- Target jQuery 1.7+
- Support CSS3 transitions over javascript animation.
- Change applyDataSettings method to applyDataToSettings.
